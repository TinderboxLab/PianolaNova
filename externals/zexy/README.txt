general::
==============================================================================
the zexy external is a collection of externals for miller.s.puckette's
realtime-computermusic-environment called "pure data" (or abbreviated "pd")
this zexy external will be of no use, if you don't have a running version of
pd on your system.
check out for http://pd.iem.at to learn more about pd and how to get it

note: the zexy external is published under the GNU General Public License
that is included (LICENSE.txt). some parts of the code are taken directly
from the pd source-code, they, of course, fall under the license pd is
published under.

making pd run with the zexy external::
==============================================================================
make sure, that pd will be looking at the location you installed zexy to.
ideally install zexy to some place, where pd already searches for libraries,
e.g. "~/.local/lib/pd/extra/" (linux), "~/Library/Pd/extra/" (macOS) or
"%AppData%\Pd\extra\" (Windows).
if this is not an option, either add the path to your "Path..." settings in pd,
or start pd with the cmdline option "-path /path/where/zexy/lives" (you can omit
the trailing "/zexy" component of the path)

make sure, that you somehow load the zexy external, either by adding "zexy" to
the "Startup..." libraries (or by starting pd with "-lib zexy"), or (and this is
the preferred method) by adding something like the following to your patches:

    [declare -path zexy -lib zexy]


bugs::
==============================================================================
if you happen to find any bugs, please report them at
   https://git.iem.at/pd/zexy


installation::
==============================================================================

linux, irix, osx, mingw,... :
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

you will need to have Pd installed, and a C-compiler (preferably gcc) as well as
some a GNUmake compatible implementation of 'make'.

on windows, you also need MSYS2/MinGW installed.

#1> make
#2> make install
