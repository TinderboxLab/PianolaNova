| Under the maintenance of Porres, Kwan and Barber: 
---------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------
cyclone 0.5-5 (needs at least Pd Vanilla 0.51-3):
--------------------------------------------------

-[anal]: fixed 'reset' message and fixed/improved documentation
-[prob]: If the window is opened: update window graphically after inputs/clear and raise window on clicking the object.
-[Table]: If the window is opened, raise window on clicking the object.
-[capture]: If the window is opened: update window graphically after inputs/clear and raise window on clicking the object.
-[capture~]: If the window is opened: update window graphically after clear and raise/update window on clicking the object.
-[scope~]: Fixed loading as "Scope~".
-[comment]: 'Menlo' is the default font for Mac, since that's Pd's default font for Mac in 0.51-3.

--------------------------------------------------
cyclone 0.5-4 (needs at least Pd Vanilla 0.51-0):
--------------------------------------------------


- Fixed packaging/uploading Upper Case aliases objects for Linux (such as Line~, etc) - this is not a change in code so this can be done for earlier 0.5 releases.
- Changed the install description, now it is advised to use [declare -path] and add it to the preferences to force search priority.
- Fixed cross compiling for windows.
- [fromsymbol]: fixed converting to floats for all float cases (regression bug from 0.3).
- Fixed loading "cyclone/snapshot~" as "cyclone/Snapshot~", and "cyclone/table" as "cyclone/Table".
- [urn]: fixed seed bug and improved/fixed documentation.
- Fixed saving and loading resizing information for object boxes, affects: [coll], [funbuff], [table] and [prob].
- [coll]: now coll window updates graphically when you're changing data via methods (before you had to close and reopen the window). Another thing is that the window now gets raised into focus if it's already open and you either click on the object or send an "open" message to it. And now deleting the object will force closing the window if it's opened (there was an exception when this didn't happen).  
- [unjoin]: fixed output order of outlets (now it's from right to left).
- [plusequals~] (or +=~): increased the output resolution to a 'double'.
- [record~]: fixed an old bug (since cyclone 0.1 phase) where record~ would freeze Pd; fixed number of channels, and now you can resize the array to a bigger size that it'll work.
- [scope~]:
   - Pd doesn't ask anymore if you want to save changes if you changed the object's parameters via messages (this is in line with how iemguis work).
   - Improved GOP management, such as erasing when out of GOP's bounds
   - Improvement of the resize mechanism via handle.
   - Redesign of the resize handle interface. Now when you get in and out of edit mode, the handle shows up in the bottom right corner for you to resize the object - there's also a new and more proper cursor for what it does "bottom_right_corner". Before you had to first select the object like in Max, but now this is more in line with how resizing regularly works for Pd, where you don't need to select the object first.
- [comment]:
   - Pd doesn't ask anymore if you want to save changes if you changed the object's parameters via messages (this is in line with how iemguis work).
   - Fixed a bug where you could lose the comment when saving the patch (regression bug from 0.5-2)
   - Fixed graph on parent (GOP) display when loading patch (regression bug from 0.5-3)
   - Fixed setting colors via a loadbang message
   - Better drawing when loading of the patch (it'd generate a wrong outline for a very brief moment before getting it right). 
   - Improved GOP management, such as erasing when out of GOP's bounds
   - Designed a new resizing handle that works much better.

--------------------------------------------------
cyclone 0.5-3 (needs at least Pd Vanilla 0.51-0):
--------------------------------------------------


- [cyclone]: Pd version check fixed in the cyclone binary (previous version would complain if you installed a version higher than 0.51-0).
- [cyclone/table]: if window is open and you set values via messages, the values are now updated graphically (you needed to close and open the window for it to reflect the changes).

- [togedge]: non integer floats not allowed as in Max.

- [mousestate]: 
      - Fixed poll message (regression bugs from 0.5-0 and 0.3). 
      - Fixed bugs in reset/zero message (update values only or if polling) 
      - Fixed polling for multiple objects in different modes.

- [scope~]: Added a missing receive symbol box in the properties window.

- [comment]:
      - Fixed getting the object's area
      - Better handling of "\" in append/prepend methods.
      - Now we draw an outline when in edit mode. 
      - There's a better handling of resizing now as well.
      - Added support for foreign alphabets.
      - More examples in the documentation on how to use backslash and different alphabets.
      - Properties: better handling of 'empty' receive symbols / fix 'bg flag'.

--------------------------------------------------
cyclone 0.5-2 (needs at least Pd Vanilla 0.51-0):
--------------------------------------------------

- scope:
   - fixed a couple of tcl/tk errors and some drawing issues when outta bounds in a GOP.
   - scope now draws inlets when in edit mode, like in Max and cyclone comment.
   - Added a receive symbol (like in comment)

- comment:
   - fixed some drawing issues when outta bounds in a GOP. Code has been revised and has now a better handling of arguments and a proper handling of dollarsign args.
   - Added a ver rudimentary and preliminary properties window 

--------------------------------------------------
cyclone 0.5-1 (needs at least Pd Vanilla 0.51-0):
--------------------------------------------------

- This bug fix release fixes a regression bug from 0.50-0 in scope~, where bufsize wasn't being set. 

--------------------------------------------------
cyclone 0.5-0 (needs at least Pd Vanilla 0.51-0):
--------------------------------------------------

- Re-added support for capital letters aliases - this is for backwards compatibility and now the object prints and error telling the user to change to the new name. The affected objects are: cyclone/append (*); bucket; cyclone/clip (*); decode; histo; mousestate; peak; cyclone/table (*); togedge; trough; uzi; cyclone/clip~ (*); cyclone/line~ (*); scope~; cyclone/snapshot~ (*)

(*) these classes need the 'cyclone/' prefix to avoid name clashes with vanilla internals - see help file for more information.

- when loaded as an object, the 'cyclone' library now also outputs the version number. You can use this to make sure your patch has the right version.

- Fixed a bug in active where it was reporting inactivity when right clicking on the canvas in Linux.

- Fixed a bug in [zl delace] where it only worked in macOS and not in Windows/Linux

- Added a few new message methods/attributes to [number~], thanks to the new inlet~ 'fwd' feature from Pd 0.51 (namely bang, list, set, ft1, interval, minimum, maximum, bgcolor, textcolor).

- [scope~]: 
   A- Fixed a regression bug in scope~ where it wouldn't draw if loaded in a patch with DSP on
   B- Added zoom support and now the patch properly asks if you want to save changes when parameters change. 

- [comment]:
   A- Added zoom support and now the patch properly asks if you want to save changes when parameters change. 
   B- Visual change where it now shows its inlet while in edit mode (like it happens in Max)
   C- Fixed a bug in [comment] where it couldn't load font names that had spaces (such as "DejaVu Sans Mono") and made the default font "DejaVu Sans Mono" like in Pd. But this only works well in Pd 0.51-0 or later!
   D- Documentation has been revised to only contain DejaVu Sans Mono fonts in all cyclone/comment objects
   E- Updated [comment] to add missing Max 5 parameters (added 'fontface', 'underline' and 'bgcolor' methods/attributes, plus an extra 'bg' method/attribute to supress background)
   F- Also added 'textjustification' from Max6. This object isn't fully compliant to Max6+ and is the only one that will not be fully updated - for instance, it misses all that "bubble stuff". Nonetheless, this was the last object that needed further updates from cyclone's 0.3's goal to update objects to Max 7. This means that this mission is finally completed!

--------------------------------------------------
cyclone 0.4-0 (needs at least Pd Vanilla 0.50-2):
--------------------------------------------------

- Fixed a 0.3 regression bug (this was ok in 0.2) where an annoying 'couldn't unbind' error was printed by [mousestate]

- Fixed a bug where [comment] was loading arguments wrongly

- Fixed the way [comment] should save unexpanded receive symbols

- Fixed a bug in [unjoin] where it did output an empty selector

- Thanks to the new [pdcontrol] object from 0.50.0, buffer~ can now load files relative to its owner patch.

- Temporarily removing support for capital letters aliases. The last version of cyclone still attempted to included capital letters for backwards compatibility but with a note that this was being phased out. The fact is that Linux distributions didn't have this working properly. Since an easy way to fix this wasn't found, cyclone 0.4 removes this backwards compatibility. The latest Max versions don't allow these aliases any longer, so you should update for conform with it. This feature may come back If an easy way to support it is found - but eventually these aliases will be phased out for good. The affected objects and how they must be instantiated now are: cyclone/append (*); bucket; cyclone/clip (*); decode; histo; mousestate; peak; cyclone/table (*); togedge; trough; uzi; cyclone/clip~ (*); cyclone/line~ (*); scope~; cyclone/snapshot~ (*)

(*) these classes need the 'cyclone/' prefix to avoid name clashes with vanilla internals - see help file for more information.

--------------------------------------------------
cyclone 0.3-0 (needs at least Pd Vanilla 0.49-0)
--------------------------------------------------

Summary: Cyclone 0.3 represents the major overhaul in cyclone and includes: 1) objects updated to the last Max 7 version (7.3.5); 2) Many new objects; 3)Numerous bug fixes; 4) Completely rewritten documentation. See details below!

A) Restoring the original cyclone's goal of Max/MSP compatibility in the project's 'readme'.

B) Restoring the 'cyclone' library. By default, this contains only the objects that used to be in the 'nettles' library, but the cyclone library also loads cyclone's path so you can load the other objects that are compiled as separate binaries or abstraction (you can now also create a [cyclone] external object that loads the library). There's a separate option on how to compile cyclone as a single library (see 'readme' for more details).

C) Readded the "threaded" behaviour in [coll] but without the extra 2nd "threaded" argument introduced to [coll] in cyclone 0.2 because it breaks Max/MSP compatibility - the second argument now sets a functionality that was introduced in Max 4.0.8 for not searching for a file. The threaded feature is now set as an extra "attribute" (@threaded 0/1) and the threaded behaviour is now the default.

D) 40 New objects, including:

2 Abstractions: [buffer~] and [number~]

38 Compiled externals: [acosh], [asinh], [atanh], [atodb], [atodb~], [bitsafe~], [cross~], [dbtoa], [dbtoa~], [degrade~], [downsamp~], [equals~] **, [gate~], [greaterthan~] **, [greaterthaneq~] **, [join], [lessthan~] **, [lessthaneq~] **, [listfunnel], [loadmess], [modulo~] **, [notequals~] **, [pak], [phaseshift~], [plusequals~] **, [pong], [rdiv] **, [rdiv~] **, [rminus] **, [rminus~] **, [round], [round~], [scale], [scale~], [selector~], [thresh~], [trunc~] and [unjoin].

** These are alphanumeric versions of the objects in the cyclone sub-library, which contains non-alphanumeric objects: ==~ - !=~ - <~ - <=~ - >~ - >=~ - !-~ - !/~ - %~ - +=~

E) Updated objects (61 Objects affected), including:

- 7 objects that were updated to include only missing functionalities from Max 4 - as some functionalities introduced after Max 4.0 were never reflected into cyclone. Since cyclone has long been considered a Max 4 compatible library, such missing functionalities may also be considered as "bugs" rather than updates:
	- [anal] - Max size increased to 16384
	- [substitute] - 1st only mode
	- [mousestate] - mode 1 and 2
	- [onebang] - 'stop' method / input for anything / right outlet
	- [slide~] - reset / slide_up / slide_down methods
	- [funbuff] - clipboard operations
	- [vectral~] - size / clear messages

- 54 objects that were updated to current Max's version; +=~ (alias of [plusequals~]) - [acos~] - [acosh~] - [asin~] - [atanh~] - [average~] - [bitand~], [bitnot~], [bitor~], [bitshift~], [bitxor~], [buffir~], [capture] *, [cartopol], [change~], [coll] *, [count~], [counter], [curve~], [cycle~], [decode], [delay~], [deltaclip~], [fromsymbol], [funnel], [linedrive], [matrix~], [maximum], [midiformat], [midiparse], [minimum], [minmax~], [mousefilter], [mtr], [offer], [overdrive~], [peak], [play~], [poltocar], [pong~], [record~], [scope~], [snapshot~], [spike~], [spray], [sustain], [table], [tosymbol], [trapezoid~], [triangle~], [trough], [uzi] *, [wave~] and [zl] *.

     * *Objects that also required updates from Max 4: [capture] - input for anythings; 
       [coll] - renumber2 method / 2nd argument; [uzi] - 2nd argument; 
       [zl] - sort method.

- 1 object partially updated; [comment], a fully compatible object for versions 6+ won't be possible and currently [comment] is partially compliant to Max 5.

F) Assorted Fixes (65 Objects affected), including:

- 33 objects that were also updated :
	- [comment] - improved the issue of not rendering the same in different platforms (still buggy), added inlet and methods, fixed behaviour in a subpatch (made it visible).

	- [bondo] - fixed the symbol method/selector
	- [cycle] - fixed the symbol method/selector
	- [capture~] - fixed data display

	- [kink~] - fixed restrains for argument
	- [rand~] - neg input becomes 0, workaround to allow max freq input = sample rate;
	- [click~] - max setable size to 256
	- [index~] - fixed the input channel clipping
	- [line~] - max pair to 128
	- [past] - bugs with list behaviour

	- [pv] - got rid of annoying error with [send] sharing the same name, made it instantiate without arguments
	- [train~] - now when width is "0" it has a pulse of 1 sample, and a pulse of "n-1" samples for width = 1 / also improved the way phase onset actually works

	- [comb~] - default max delay to 10ms / allowing blowups / corrected the filter formula
	- [teeth~] - newly written object based on the new rewrite of [comb~], adding full compatibility/functionality to the external and fixing bugs - this object was introduced in alpha57 as an abstraction by porres and made into a compiled object in 0.2beta2
	- [lookup~] - max table size is array's size, added linear interpolation
	- [onepole~] - default args
	- [thresh] - fixed input message types and errors
	- [append] - fixed useless inlet bug, bang behaviour and symbol input
	- [prepend] - fixed useless inlet bug, bang behaviour

	- [sampstoms~] - float input now reflects on signal output
	- [mstosamps~] - float input now reflects on signal output
	- [asin] - removed protection against nan (was unchecked)
	- [acos] - removed protection against nan (was unchecked)

G) Objects' names to lowcase by default and avoiding nameclash [17 Objects affected]: [line~], [scope~], [uzi], [borax], [bucket], [decode], [histo], [peak], [trough], [clip], [pow~], [clip~], [snapshot~], [table], [mousestate], [togedge] and [append]

H) Fixing proper input types for signal objects (mostly not allowing float input in main signal input), 64 objects affected: non-alphanumeric objects **, [acos~], [acosh~], [allpass~], [asin~], [asinh~], [atan~], [atan2~], [atanh~], [avg~], [bitand~], [bitor~], [bitxor~], [buffir~], [capture~], [cartopol~], [click~], [clip~], [comb~], [cosh~], [cosx~], [curve~], [delay~], [delta~], [deltaclip~], [edge~], [frameaccum~], [framedelta~], [index~], [kink~], [lookup~], [lores~], [matrix~], [minmax~], [maximum~], [minimum~], [onepole~], [peakamp~], [phasewrap~], [pink~], [poltocar~], [pow~], [rampsmooth~], [reson~], [sah~], [sinh~], [sinx~], [slide~], [spike~], [svf~], [tanh~], [tanx~], [vectral~], [wave~] and [zerox~]

** non-alphanumeric objects are: ==~ - !=~ - <~ - <=~ - >~ - >=~ - !-~ - !/~ - %~ - +=~

I) Other things removed/included: Replaced the [output~] abstraction by an extra named [out~], borrowed from the "else" library. Another object borrowed from "else" is [setdsp~]. Objects [abs~] and [log~] were deleted because now vanilla also has these objects with the exact same function/behaviour, so they became redundanct. We also completely removed 'cyclist' from the build system and threw away the code (this was something that could make patches from max 4 era open in Pd with cyclone, but this needed 'maxmode' to run, which already had been removed in 0.1alpha57.

J) Completely rewritten and redesigned documentation, solving numerous issues/mistakes (still in progress)
